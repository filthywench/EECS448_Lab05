            <p id="bio">Hi there! My name is Jesse Eisenberg. I am an oscar-nominated actor and have also been in the running for two BAFTA awards, two Golden Globes, and more. I'm most well-known for my roles in the Social Network, Now You See Me, Zombieland, and many others. My birthday is October 5th, 1983. </p>  
            <p><b>FUN FACT: </b>My 37th birthday was celebrated in Self Hall by two students at the University of Kansas, where strawberry cheesecake was eaten at 9:00 AM while my favorite song played in the background.</p>
